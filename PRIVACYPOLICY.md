# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 10, 2025_

Paramount Quality+ ("the extension") is a browser extension designed to help you adjust streaming quality and related playback settings on Paramount+. We respect your privacy and aim to be transparent about how the extension handles data.

## Data Collection and Use

- **No personal data collected:** The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing history.
- **Settings stored via browser sync:** Quality preferences (including `forceMax` and `forcedId`) and other configuration options are saved using the browser's extension storage. In Chromium-based browsers, this uses `chrome.storage.sync`, which may sync your settings to your Google account and store them on Google servers so they can be restored on other devices where you are signed in. These values are only used to apply your chosen settings to Paramount+ playback.
- **No tracking or analytics:** The extension does not include third-party analytics, trackers, or advertising libraries.

## Permissions

The extension requests only the permissions necessary to function:

- **Site access:** To modify playback quality on Paramount+, the extension injects scripts into Paramount+ pages when you visit the site.
- **Storage:** Used exclusively to save your quality and playback preferences locally.

## Data Sharing

- **No sharing:** The extension does not share any information with Paramount+, CBS, or other third parties.

## Security

- **Local processing:** All logic runs locally in your browser; no external servers are contacted by the extension.
- **Updates:** If updates introduce new permissions or data handling, you will be prompted by your browser before they take effect.

## Your Choices

- **Disable or remove:** You may disable or remove the extension at any time through your browser's extension management page.
- **Delete settings:** Removing the extension deletes all locally stored preferences.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. Significant changes will be reflected in the version and date above.

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the maintainer of the Paramount Quality+ project.
