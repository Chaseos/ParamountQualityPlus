# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 10, 2025_

Paramount Plus Quality Controller ("the extension") is a browser extension designed to help you adjust streaming quality and related playback settings on Paramount+. We respect your privacy and aim to be transparent about how the extension handles data.

## Data Collection and Use

- **No personal data collected:** The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing history.
- **Local-only settings:** Quality preferences and other configuration options are stored locally in your browser using extension storage. They are only used to apply your chosen settings to Paramount+ playback.
- **No tracking or analytics:** The extension does not include third-party analytics, trackers, or advertising libraries.

## Permissions

The extension requests only the permissions necessary to function:

- **Site access:** To modify playback quality on Paramount+, the extension injects scripts into Paramount+ pages when you visit the site.
- **Storage:** Used exclusively to save your quality and playback preferences locally.

## Data Sharing

- **No sharing:** The extension does not share any information with Paramount+, CBS, or other third parties.

## Security

- **Local processing:** All logic runs locally in your browser; no external servers are contacted by the extension.
- **Updates:** If updates introduce new permissions or data handling, you will be prompted by your browser before they take effect.

## Your Choices

- **Disable or remove:** You may disable or remove the extension at any time through your browser's extension management page.
- **Delete settings:** Removing the extension deletes all locally stored preferences.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. Significant changes will be reflected in the version and date above.
